Django provides a inspectdb method to import the sql database to Django python files. 
Django doesn't support weak entities or combined primary keys. An alternative to do it is adding 'unique_together' constraints and not defining primary keys so django will automatically add an ID to the model.
Django supports foreign keys, but not values of other columns of the model as the foreign key 
    e.g. if Flight's airline_name points to airplane, you can only get the airplane's pk (or another unique key) but not airplane's airline name. 
Django's models are more object oriented than MySQL schemas. For this reason and to maintain low coupling I'm using airplane (an object) instad of (airline_name, airplane_id) (a set of attributes representing the object) as a foreign key. Similar for other foreign keys.
I'm following Corey Schafer's tutorial on Django.
